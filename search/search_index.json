Alignment is then performed using STAR , followed by deduplication. Peaks are then called, where both unique and multimapped read counts are identified. Peaks are then collapsed, annotated, and summarized into reports. If designated either MANORM or DIFFBIND is performed on peak findings. QC reports are also generated with each project. The following are sub-commands used within iCLIP: initialize: initalize the pipeline dryrun: predict the binding of peptides to any MHC molecule cluster: execute the pipeline on the Biowulf HPC local: execute a local, interactive, session git: execute GitHub actions unlock: unlock directory DAG: create DAG report report: create SNAKEMAKE report 1.2 Setup Dependencies\u00b6 iCLIP has several dependencies listed below.
